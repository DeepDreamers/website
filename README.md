Bring your favourite artists alive in a VR Experience

Deep Dreamers is an open source framework that renders Fully ThreeJS VR Enabled Apps using Deep Dream and Style Transfer neuronal network algorithms.

This project is a Google Experiment Project.

Note from the creator:

This project was created because one of my dreams as a musician was be able to play with my favorite musicians, the people that inspired me to start with the music, they bring happiness to my life everytime I listen them songs, such a Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Queen, and others sublime artists. Unfortunately the majority of my favorite artists are dead. I’m sure that I’m not the only person in the world that wanted to experience a concert or even play with their favorite musician, alive or dead. That’s why I’m building this framework, Every person in the world will be able to experience using amazing technologies such a Virtual Reality and also, use complex algorithms to generate concerts using videos of previous concerts to render VR Deep Dream Experience.
